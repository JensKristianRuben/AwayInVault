# AwayInVault

AwayinVault is a secure password manager built with Svelte 5 that uses client-side AES-256 encryption to ensure your master password never leaves your browser. It features a custom password generator, secure local validation, and a responsive dark-themed interface for managing your credentials safely. All data is encrypted locally using CryptoJS before being sent to the Java Spring Boot backend, ensuring a true zero-knowledge architecture.
