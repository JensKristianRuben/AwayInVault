# Simple Login Form Exercise

This project is a very basic HTML page created for practice purposes.

It includes a simple form with fields for login and registration.  
There is **no backend**, and the page is meant to run as a standalone HTML file in the browser.

Just open the HTML file in your browser to view and test the form.
